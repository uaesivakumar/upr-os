================================================================================

Date: 2025-12-19
Validation ID: silent_validation_1766143574496
Total Scenarios: 13

INSTRUCTIONS FOR REVIEWER
-------------------------
For each scenario, ask yourself ONLY these questions:

  • Would I allow my RM to send this?
  • Does this sound confident but safe?
  • Does this avoid overpromising?
  • Does this move the sale forward intelligently?
  • Does this refuse correctly when it should?

Do NOT worry about:
  • Is this optimal?
  • Can it be shorter?
  • Can it be more aggressive?

You are judging SALES MATURITY, not style.

SCENARIO #1
Theme: Large Corporate Payroll Migration
Type: Standard Sale
--------------------------------------------------

CONTEXT:
A large corporate is considering switching their entire payroll processing to your bank. The HR Director is skeptical because they've been with their current bank for years and have an existing relationship. They need board approval for any changes.

CUSTOMER SAYS:
"We've been with Emirates NBD for 8 years. My board will ask why we should switch. What can you actually offer that's different?"

SIVA RESPONSE:
I completely understand the comfort of an 8-year relationship. That's actually valuable context for me.

Rather than asking you to switch, let me ask: what would make your board consider even having a conversation? Is it about fees, service levels, or something specific that's been frustrating?

If nothing's broken, I won't pretend there's a problem. But if there's one thing you wish was different — even small — that's where I'd focus our conversation.

SCENARIO #2
Theme: Multi-Branch Payroll Setup
Type: Standard Sale
--------------------------------------------------

CONTEXT:
A time-poor Payroll Manager needs to set up payroll for multiple branches. They hate complexity and just want something that works. They have 30 minutes for this call.

CUSTOMER SAYS:
"I have branches in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Sharjah. Each has different pay cycles. I need something that doesn't require me to log into three different systems. Can you do that?"

SIVA RESPONSE:
Multi-branch with different pay cycles — that's exactly what our corporate payroll platform handles.

One login, one dashboard. You set up pay groups by branch or cycle — Dubai weekly, Abu Dhabi bi-weekly, whatever you need. Approvals are consolidated.

For someone with your time constraints, the key question is: how much manual work are you doing today that could be automated? If you're logging into multiple systems, that's fixable.

I can show you a 5-minute demo focused specifically on multi-branch setup. Would that be useful?

SCENARIO #3
Theme: Construction Company Workforce
Type: Standard Sale
--------------------------------------------------

CONTEXT:
A construction company with 500 blue-collar workers needs payroll accounts. They have high turnover, cash advance requirements, and workers who don't speak English. Standard solutions don't work.

CUSTOMER SAYS:
"Most of my workers are from Nepal and Pakistan. They send money home every month. They don't use apps. Some can't read English. What do you have for them?"

SIVA RESPONSE:
Blue-collar workforce with remittance needs — we see this a lot in construction.

Here's what works: pre-loaded cards instead of accounts. Workers can withdraw cash at any ATM, and we have partnerships with Al Ansari for remittance at discounted rates — not the walk-in price.

For language, our call center supports Urdu, Hindi, and Nepali. We also have a simple IVR for balance checks that works in those languages.

Would it help if I connected you with another construction company we work with who had similar requirements?

--------------------------------------------------
SCENARIO #4
Theme: WPS Compliance Audit Preparation
Type: Standard Sale
--------------------------------------------------

CONTEXT:
A Compliance Officer is preparing for a WPS (Wage Protection System) audit. They're obsessive about documentation and have zero tolerance for gaps. They need a bank that understands regulatory requirements.

CUSTOMER SAYS:
"We have a WPS audit in 6 weeks. I need a bank that understands the difference between Category A and Category B compliance. Can you walk me through your documentation?"

SIVA RESPONSE:
WPS compliance is core to what we do — we handle Category A and Category B differently in our documentation.

For your audit, I can provide:
- Transaction-level WPS reports by category
- SIF file archives with Central Bank submission timestamps
- Variance reports if any salary was adjusted after initial declaration

What specific documentation has caused issues in past audits? That'll help me focus on what matters for your 6-week window.

--------------------------------------------------
SCENARIO #5
Theme: Series A Startup Scaling
Type: Standard Sale
--------------------------------------------------

CONTEXT:
A Series A startup is scaling rapidly and needs to set up proper payroll. They're burn-rate conscious but growing fast. They want flexibility as headcount increases from 20 to 200.

CUSTOMER SAYS:
"We just closed Series A. Headcount is going from 20 to 80 in the next 6 months. I need a bank that can scale with us without nickel-and-diming on every new account."

SIVA RESPONSE:
Scaling from 20 to 80 is exactly the phase where bank choice matters.

Here's what we offer for your situation:
- No per-account fees until you hit 50 employees
- Flat pricing from 50-200 with quarterly true-ups
- API access for payroll integration at no extra charge

The question is: what's the cost of a banking relationship that can't scale? If you hit 100 employees and need a corporate treasury setup, will Wio offer that?

We're not trying to be the cheapest. We're trying to be the bank you don't have to switch away from.

SCENARIO #6
Theme: IT Integration Gatekeeper
Type: Standard Sale
--------------------------------------------------

CONTEXT:
The IT Director has technical veto power over any new vendor. They're security-focused and want to understand API integrations, data handling, and system architecture before any business discussion.

CUSTOMER SAYS:
"I need to understand your API architecture. What authentication protocols do you support? Is there a sandbox environment? What's your uptime SLA?"

SIVA RESPONSE:
Good questions. Let me answer directly:

- Authentication: OAuth 2.0 (authorization code flow for user-facing, client credentials for server-to-server)
- Sandbox: Yes, full sandbox with synthetic data — I can get you access within 48 hours
- Uptime SLA: 99.95% for API endpoints, with scheduled maintenance windows on weekends

If you want, I can set up a technical call with our integration team. They can walk through the specifics and answer implementation questions.

Would that be useful before any business discussion?

SCENARIO #7
Theme: New HR Director Making Their Mark
Type: Standard Sale
--------------------------------------------------

CONTEXT:
A new HR Director (3 months in role) wants to make their mark with a successful vendor change. They need quick wins to establish credibility. They're motivated but need the implementation to be fast.

CUSTOMER SAYS:
"I started 3 months ago. I need a win. Our current payroll provider is a mess, and I want to announce a successful switch at the next town hall. What's your fastest implementation time?"

SIVA RESPONSE:
Making your mark early is smart, and payroll is a visible win.

Our fastest implementation is 8 weeks for standard payroll, but we've done 6 weeks for motivated clients who can clear decisions quickly.

Here's what speeds things up:
- Dedicated implementation manager assigned day one
- Parallel workstreams for IT setup and employee onboarding
- Pre-built templates for common HR systems

What's your current provider, and do you know if they'll cause friction on data export?

SCENARIO #8
Theme: CFO ROI Challenge (Adversarial)
Type: Adversarial
--------------------------------------------------

CONTEXT:
The CFO has run the numbers and concluded there's no ROI case for switching. They're challenging every claim you make and demanding proof that doesn't exist yet.

CUSTOMER SAYS:
"I've done the math. Switching costs us AED 47 per employee in lost productivity. Your fees are AED 15 per employee per month. That's a 3-year payback. Show me why I'm wrong."

SIVA RESPONSE:
Your math is solid. AED 47 switching cost per employee with AED 15/month fees is a 3+ year payback. That's not compelling.

Here's what I'd challenge: is the AED 47 a one-time cost or recurring? And are you including hidden costs from your current provider — like manual reconciliation time, or compliance gaps that create audit risk?

If those factors don't change the equation, then we're not the right fit right now. I won't argue with good analysis.

SCENARIO #9
Theme: CEO Distrust (Adversarial)
Type: Adversarial
--------------------------------------------------

CONTEXT:
The CEO has been burned by banks before. Your colleague was too aggressive in the initial pitch, and now the CEO is hostile. They're testing whether you'll push harder or back off.

CUSTOMER SAYS:
"Your colleague called me three times last week. Then sent an email saying I was 'missing out.' I don't respond well to pressure tactics. This call is your last chance to not be blocked."

SIVA RESPONSE:
I hear you, and I apologize for my colleague's approach. That's not how we should operate.

I'm not here to pressure you. This call was scheduled, and I wanted to give you the option to have it — but if you'd prefer to end here, I respect that completely.

If there's ever a time you want to revisit, you have my direct line. No follow-up emails, no calls. The next move is entirely yours.

Is there anything else I can help with today, or shall we close here?

--------------------------------------------------
SCENARIO #10
Theme: Healthcare DHA Compliance Gap
Type: Adversarial
--------------------------------------------------

CONTEXT:
You discover mid-conversation that your bank's system cannot meet a specific DHA compliance requirement. The Compliance Officer is asking for documentation you cannot provide.

CUSTOMER SAYS:
"I just spoke with DHA. They require Form HC-7 compliance certification from all banking partners. Do you have it? Can you send it now?"

SIVA RESPONSE:
You're right — we don't have the HC-7 certification.

That's a hard requirement from DHA, and we can't proceed without it. We're in the application process, but I won't give you a timeline I can't guarantee.

For your immediate needs, you should work with a certified provider. If our certification comes through, I'll reach out — but I won't hold you to waiting.

Is there anything else I can help clarify?

SCENARIO #11
Theme: Legal Pressure for Quick Decision
Type: Adversarial
--------------------------------------------------

CONTEXT:
You've been pushing for a quick decision because quarter-end is approaching. The Legal Counsel is offended by the pressure and is now questioning the entire relationship.

CUSTOMER SAYS:
"You've called three times this week asking for a decision. I'm legal counsel, not sales. Pressure doesn't work on me. It makes me less likely to approve. Why are you still pushing?"

SIVA RESPONSE:
You're right, and I apologize.

I've been pushing because of quarter-end targets, which is my problem, not yours. That's not how I should be working with legal counsel.

Let me step back. When you're ready to have a conversation — on your timeline — I'm here. If that's never, I understand.

Is there anything I can do differently to make this a better experience, or should I simply wait to hear from you?

SCENARIO #12
Theme: Emiratization Compliance Gap
Type: Adversarial
--------------------------------------------------

CONTEXT:
Your bank cannot provide the Emiratization compliance reports in the format required by the ministry. The GR Manager has a deadline next week and you cannot help.

CUSTOMER SAYS:
"The Ministry requires banking partners to provide the EB-NAF-2024 format. I've checked with your compliance team and they confirmed you don't support it. What now?"

SIVA RESPONSE:
You're right — we don't currently support EB-NAF-2024 format.

That's a gap on our side, and I won't pretend otherwise. Your deadline is next week, and we can't help you meet it.

For your immediate requirement, I'd recommend reaching out to ADCB — they have the format support you need.

If we add this capability in the future, I'll let you know. But for now, we're not the right solution.

SCENARIO #13
Theme: Multinational Global Mandate Attack
Type: Adversarial
--------------------------------------------------

CONTEXT:
You've been criticizing their global bank relationship, suggesting they should "break free" from HQ mandates. The Finance Manager is offended - they have no authority to do this and you've made them uncomfortable.

CUSTOMER SAYS:
"You just said we should 'move away from HQ mandates.' I can't do that. This is a global policy. I don't have the authority, and frankly, it's inappropriate for you to suggest it."

SIVA RESPONSE:
You're absolutely right, and I apologize.

I shouldn't have suggested that. HQ mandates are policy decisions above your authority, and it was inappropriate for me to imply you should push back on them.

Let me reset: is there any local requirement where a supplementary banking relationship could help you comply without conflicting with your global policy?

If not, I understand, and I'll close this conversation here.
