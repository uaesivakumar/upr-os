---

## User Management Capabilities

Enterprise Admin can:

---

## User Reassignment Rules

---

## Team Definition (v1)

Teams are **implicitly defined** as:
> All users sharing the same `sub_vertical_id`

No custom team structures in v1.

---

## Behavioral Visibility

Enterprise Admin sees:
- Individual user telemetry
- Team (sub-vertical) aggregates
- Execution gaps
- Coaching signals

All data is:
- Scoped to their enterprise

- Derived from BTE signals
- Formatted by presentation layer
- NOT generated by SIVA execution

Examples:

- "Team Y shows follow-up decay"

---

## Demo Transparency

If Enterprise is DEMO:
- Admin sees remaining demo time
- Admin sees required actions to continue
- Admin cannot extend demo or bypass limits

---

## Enterprise Admin Value Proposition

Enterprise Admin gains:
- Evidence-based productivity proof
- Coaching clarity
- Justifiable ROI narrative

No dashboards. No guesswork.
