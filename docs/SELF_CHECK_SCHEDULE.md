## 📊 Progress Tracking Framework

### How We Measure Progress (Honest Method)

**Phase Completion Criteria**:
- 0-25%: Planning/Design only
- 26-50%: Partial implementation, missing key deliverables
- 51-75%: Most deliverables complete, testing in progress
- 76-99%: All deliverables complete, documentation partial
- 100%: All deliverables + documentation + tests complete

**Overall SIVA Progress Calculation**:
```
Total Progress = (Sum of all phase completion %) / 12 phases
```

**Current (Sprint 23)**:
```
Phase 1: 10%
Phase 2: 30%
Phase 3: 0%
Phase 4: 80%
Phase 5: 40%
Phase 6: 0%
Phase 7: 0%
Phase 8: 0%
Phase 9: 50%
Phase 10: 25%
Phase 11: 0%
Phase 12: 0%
──────────────
Total: 235% / 12 = 19.6% ≈ 20%
```

**Target (Sprint 24)**:
```
Phase 1: 80% (+70)
Phase 2: 80% (+50)
Phase 3: 10% (+10) [design only]
Phase 4: 80% (no change)
Phase 5: 55% (+15) [ContactTier rule engine]
Phase 6: 0%
Phase 7: 5% (+5) [design planning]
Phase 8: 0%
Phase 9: 50%
Phase 10: 30% (+5) [schema design]
Phase 11: 0%
Phase 12: 0%
──────────────
Total: 390% / 12 = 32.5% ≈ 33%
```

## 🚨 Red Flags (When to Pause and Reassess)

### Feature Track Red Flags:
- Match rates declining over time
- Stress tests failing consistently
- Production errors increasing
- Decision logging broken
- Rule engines slower than inline logic

### Foundation Track Red Flags:
- Documentation falling more than 1 sprint behind
- Architecture diagrams don't match reality
- Golden dataset not being updated
- Progress claims vs. reality diverging
- No one can explain the cognitive framework

### Overall Red Flags:
- Sprint 26: Still <40% progress
- Sprint 30: Still <55% progress
- Sprint 36: Still <70% progress
- Any phase stuck at same % for 3+ sprints
- Technical debt accumulating faster than we're paying it down

**If 2+ red flags appear**: PAUSE features, focus on foundation

## 📝 Self-Check Process (How to Conduct)

### 1. Prepare (1 day before checkpoint)
- Export all metrics from production
- Review all sprint completion reports
- Gather match rate data
- Count production decisions
- List all deliverables completed

### 2. Assess (Checkpoint day)
- Answer all checkpoint questions honestly
- Calculate phase completion percentages
- Update phases_summary_HONEST.json
- Identify red flags
- Document lessons learned

### 3. Document (1 day after checkpoint)
- Write checkpoint assessment document
- Update roadmap with revised timelines
- Create action items for gaps
- Share with stakeholders (if any)
- Plan next sprint scope

### 4. Decide (Sprint planning)
- Continue hybrid approach? OR
- Adjust track balance? OR
- Switch to framework-first?
- Define next sprint dual-track scope
- Set clear success criteria

## 🎯 Commitment to Honesty

At each checkpoint, we commit to:

1. **Honest % Calculation**: Use actual deliverables, not aspirations
2. **No False Claims**: Don't mark phases complete without evidence
3. **Document Reality**: Architecture diagrams must match actual code
4. **Track Technical Debt**: List shortcuts taken and plan to fix
5. **Adjust Timeline**: If behind, extend timeline, don't lower standards
6. **Transparent Communication**: Share real progress, not wishful thinking
7. **Learn from Gaps**: Understand why we fell behind, prevent repeats

**If we fall behind, we adjust the plan, not the honesty.**
